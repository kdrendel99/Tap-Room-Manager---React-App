#### By **Karlson Drendel**

## Technologies Used

* JavaScript
* React
* Node.js
* npm
* Webpack

## Description
This app allows for full CRUD functionality providing a manager (the user) to add, edit, delete, and view the keg data. Users can view beer details or a list of all beers at the taproom. Users can also track the number of pints sold for each beer without needing to enter into the Details page. This application was created to learn how to handle local and shared state within a React application without using hooks or libraries such as Redux.
